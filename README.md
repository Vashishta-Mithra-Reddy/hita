# Hita

Hita is an AI-powered knowledge platform focused on well-being and healthy living. It curates and presents information across:

- Foods (nutritional info, benefits, dietary badges, seasonal/region availability)
- Products (brands, categories, links, offline availability, features, tags)
- Brands (overview and associated products)
- Remedies (ingredients, preparation, usage, symptoms treated)
- Supplementation guides
- Wellness tips
- AI Agent (intelligent search and recommendations)
- Health Issues (browse content by specific health concerns)
- User Submissions (community-contributed content)

It is built with Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage), TypeScript, OpenAI for vector embeddings, and Google GenAI for enhanced AI capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- A Supabase project with Postgres enabled

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Notes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are used for the app's Supabase client on both server and browser contexts via `lib/supabase/client.ts` and `lib/supabase/server.ts`.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is required by the embeddings script to perform admin operations.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required by the embeddings script to create vector embeddings.
- Additional API keys may be required for Google GenAI integration.

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed in your terminal to view the app.

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Start the production server

```bash
npm start
```

## Data Layer

The app uses Supabase Postgres tables for content such as categories, brands, products, foods, remedies, supplementation guides, wellness tips, and embeddings. See `supabase/schema.sql` for the canonical database structure.

Typed query helpers:

- Products: `lib/supabase/products.ts`
  - Includes nested joins with `brand:brands(*)`, `category:categories(*)`, `product_links(*)`, and `offline_availability(*)`.
- Foods: `lib/supabase/foods.ts`
  - Includes helpers to safely extract nested data (vitamins, minerals, seasons, regions).
- Remedies: `lib/supabase/remedies.ts`
  - Includes helpers for remedy categories, ingredients, and preparation methods.
- Wellness Tips: `lib/supabase/wellness.ts`

## Pages Overview

- Foods: browse and detail pages with bento-style sections (nutritional info, badges, benefits, availability)
- Products: browse and detail pages, brand/category info, links, and offline availability
- Brands: index and detail pages, including associated products
- Remedies: index and detail pages (ingredients, preparation, usage)
- Wellness Tips: list and filter by category
- Agent: AI-powered search interface with semantic search capabilities
- Issues: browse content organized by specific health concerns
- Submit: authenticated content submission system for user contributions
- Auth: complete authentication flow (sign up, login, password reset, email confirmation, password update)

Skeleton components under `components/skeletons/` provide consistent loading placeholders across pages.

## Embeddings Population

The script at `scripts/populate.ts` generates aggregated content for:

- Products, Foods, Remedies, Supplementation Guides, Wellness Tips

It creates OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) and inserts them into an `embeddings` table with a `vector(1536)` column.

Before running:

1. Ensure your `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. The script attempts to ensure the `embeddings` table exists via a Postgres RPC called `exec_sql`. If that RPC isnâ€™t available in your project, the script will print the SQL for you to run manually. You can create the table by running this SQL in the Supabase SQL editor:

```plaintext
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embeddings (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  content text NOT NULL,
  embedding vector(1536),
  content_type text NOT NULL,
  source_id uuid NOT NULL,
  metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS embeddings_content_type_idx ON embeddings(content_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS embeddings_source_id_idx ON embeddings(source_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS embeddings_embedding_idx ON embeddings USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

Run the script (without installing additional dev dependencies) using `npx`:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts\populate.ts
```

Alternatively, you can add a dev tool like `ts-node` or `tsx` and run it accordingly.

The script will:

- Load all relevant content (active records only)
- Generate aggregated text for each record
- Create embeddings with retry/backoff
- Insert embeddings in batches for efficiency

## Configuration

- Next.js config: `next.config.ts` (remote image host)
